        <h2>Don't worry! Unlike most other phishing attacks, none of your data was submitted, logged, or compromised.
        Instead, we're using this as a learning opportunity to help people protect themselves against phishing.</h2>
<br>
        <h2>Phishing is an attack that involves attackers posing as reputable sources in an attempt to try and steal sensitive information like passwords, SSN, credit card numbers, etc.</h2>
        <br>
        <h2>Phishing attacks may not even take much time, money, or effort to create. In fact, the UBHacking website took no longer than 60 minutes to imitate.</h2>
        <br>
        <h2>People with all levels of technological experience are vulnerable to phishing.</h2>
        <br>
        <h2 style="padding-bottom: 3%;">Here are some tips to avoid getting phished:</h2>
        <div class="left">
          <p>• Always check the source of the link, are they reputable? Are they trying to impersonate a reputable person/organization?</p>
          <p>• If you do fall for a phishing attack, immediately change or delete all accounts that are accessible via the compromised data.
          Also reach out to the support teams of services you been compromised at to inform them of the breach.</p>
          <p>• Always look for mistakes on the website. Phishing attacks can be more successful when targets are not looking close enough.</p>

        <h2>Here are some examples:</h2>
        <h3>Similar Domains:</h3>
        <img class="error_image" src="../static/url_diff.png"/>
        <p>Note: The UBHacking domain is used with the .org extension as opposed to the correct .com</p>
        <h3>Incorrect Routes:</h3>
        <img class="error_image" src="../static/route_diff.png">
        <p>Note: The "Schedule" and "Judging Info" tabs redirect to the "Log In" page.</p>
        <h3>Typos:</h3>
        <img class="error_image" src="../static/Home_differences.png"/>
        <p>Note: The "Home", "Schedule", and "DevPost" buttons are misspelt.</p>
        <h3>Exaggerated information:</h3>
        <img class="error_image" src="../static/About_differences.png"/>
        <p>Note: Information is exaggerated to possibly entice victims.</p>
        <h3>Images not loading properly:</h3>
        <img class="error_image" src="../static/Sponsor_differences.png"/>
        <p>Note: Attackers may not have access to all assets they are trying to imitate.</p>
        <h3>Griefing:</h3>
        <img class="error_image" src="../static/meet_diff.png"/>
        <p>Note: Unsecure websites may have been modified by malicious users.</p>

        <br>
    <h3>In summary, staying vigilant is essential to protect yourself from phishing attacks.
        Recognize common tactics, verify links/urls, and think twice before submitting sensitive information to reduce risks in the digital realm.</h3>
